- 👋 Hi, I’m @BioinfoZach
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about the relevant languages for bioinformatics applications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Linux (specifically the awk language) in Bioinformatics applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coming up with new ways to increase the efficiency of my code or even improvements in my analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me: Through GitHub directly.
